# ZeroTrace Identity & Visual Guidelines

**Tagline:** *Non-Persistent Intelligence. Permanent Accountability.*

## Core Brand Concepts

| Concept | Stylization | Why it works |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **The Bridge** | **ZER0**TRACE | Uses the "0" as the anchor point in the middle of the word. |
| **The Cipher** | **[Z]Trace** | Suggests a "Zero-Knowledge" proof or an encapsulated process. |
| **The Absolute** | **ZeroTrace** | Clean, high-end, and fits alongside names like VerticGraph. |

## Visual Aesthetic

- **Primary Colors:** Deep Navy (Trust, Authority), Slate Grey (Stability), Cyber Blue (Tech/Security Accent).
- **Style:** Minimalist, Executive, "Nano Banana" clean lines.
- **Feel:** Weighty, Authoritative, Established. Avoids "leet-speak" or "hacker" clichés in favor of corporate solidity.

## Logo Usage

The logotype should emphasize the transition from "Zero" to "Trace", utilizing the "0" as a bridging element where appropriate.
